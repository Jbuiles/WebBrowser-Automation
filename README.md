# WebBrowser-Automation

# What is it?
These are Python scripts I wrote using the Selenium Python library to test the viability of automating tasks and navigating through web pages using Python code. I used Outwar(https://www.outwar.com) which is a popular online web based RPG game as a testing ground for my code. As of this moment, all code works as intended and is able to automate complex tasks such as opening the web browser, navigating to the desired website, logging in with user information via emulated keystrokes and mouse clicks and then performing in game functions such as forming, launching and joining individual accounts to defeat bosses in the game.

# How does it work?
Using Python and selenium, I can extract CSS or individual HTML elements and save them to be used within the python code. For example, if I want to click a certain button on the page, I can extract the location of that button into my code, and then execute a function to have that button clicked on the web page.

# What can it be used for?
Besides using it for online games, this can be used to automate tedious and repetitive tasks on web pages in a business environment for web-based applications
